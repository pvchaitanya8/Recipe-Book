        </p>
    
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>4 large bell peppers (any color of your choice)</li>
          <li>1 cup cooked rice (white or brown)</li>
          <li>1 lb ground beef (you can also use ground turkey or chicken for a leaner option)</li>
          <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
          <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
          <li>1 cup canned diced tomatoes (or fresh tomatoes, diced)</li>
          <li>1 cup tomato sauce or marinara sauce</li>
          <li>1 cup shredded cheese (cheddar, mozzarella, or a blend)</li>
          <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
          <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
          <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
          <li>Optional: chopped fresh parsley or cilantro for garnish</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
          <li>Prepare the bell peppers: Cut off the tops of the bell peppers and remove the seeds and membranes from the inside. Rinse them thoroughly under cold water. If needed, you can also slightly trim the bottoms of the peppers to help them stand upright.</li>
          <li>In a large pot of boiling water, blanch the bell peppers for about 3-4 minutes to soften them slightly. Remove them from the boiling water and set them aside.</li>
          <li>In a large skillet or frying pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and sauté until it becomes translucent, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
          <li>Add the minced garlic to the skillet and sauté for an additional 30 seconds until fragrant.</li>
          <li>Add the ground beef to the skillet and cook it until it's browned and fully cooked. Break up any large chunks of meat as it cooks. Drain excess fat if necessary.</li>
          <li>Stir in the cooked rice, diced tomatoes, dried oregano, dried basil, paprika, salt, and pepper. Cook for another 2-3 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together. Taste and adjust seasonings as desired.</li>
          <li>Pour half of the tomato sauce into a baking dish large enough to hold the stuffed peppers.</li>
          <li>Stuff the bell peppers with the meat and rice mixture, pressing it down gently to fill the cavities. Top each stuffed pepper with some shredded cheese.</li>
          <li>Place the stuffed peppers in the baking dish on top of the tomato sauce.</li>
          <li>Pour the remaining tomato sauce over the stuffed peppers.</li>
          <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25-30 minutes or until the peppers are tender.</li>
          <li>Remove the foil and continue baking for an additional 10 minutes or until the cheese on top is melted and slightly golden.</li>
          <li>Carefully remove the stuffed bell peppers from the oven, and let them cool for a few minutes before serving.</li>
          <li>Optionally, garnish with chopped fresh parsley or cilantro before serving.</li>
        </ol>
    
        <p>
