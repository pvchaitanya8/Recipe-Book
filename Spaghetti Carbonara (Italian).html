        <p>Spaghetti Carbonara is a classic Italian pasta dish known for its creamy sauce made with eggs, cheese, and pancetta or guanciale. Here's a step-by-step preparation method for making delicious Spaghetti Carbonara:</p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>400g (14 oz) spaghetti</li>
            <li>150g (5 oz) pancetta or guanciale, diced</li>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup grated Pecorino Romano cheese (or a mix of Pecorino Romano and Parmigiano-Reggiano)</li>
            <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Salt (optional, as the pancetta and cheese are already salty)</li>
            <li>Olive oil (optional, for saut√©ing)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions:</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <h4>Boil the Pasta:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fill a large pot with water and bring it to a rolling boil.</li>
                    <li>Add a generous amount of salt to the boiling water (optional, but it helps to season the pasta).</li>
                    <li>Add the spaghetti and cook it according to the package instructions until al dente. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>Cook the Pancetta or Guanciale:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat a large skillet over medium heat.</li>
                    <li>If the pancetta or guanciale is very fatty, you might not need extra oil. Otherwise, add a splash of olive oil to the skillet.</li>
                    <li>Add the diced pancetta or guanciale to the skillet and cook until it becomes crispy and lightly browned. Stir occasionally.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>Prepare the Sauce:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, grated Pecorino Romano cheese, and a generous amount of freshly ground black pepper. The cheese and pancetta are already salty, so additional salt is usually not needed. Adjust the black pepper to your taste.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>Combine the Ingredients:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Once the pasta is al dente, use tongs to transfer it directly from the pot to the skillet with the cooked pancetta or guanciale. It's okay if some pasta water comes along; it will help create a creamy sauce.</li>
                    <li>Remove the skillet from the heat to avoid cooking the eggs too quickly and forming scrambled eggs.</li>
                    <li>Immediately pour the egg and cheese mixture over the hot pasta and toss everything together quickly. The residual heat from the pasta will cook the eggs and create a creamy, luscious sauce.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>Serve and Garnish:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Divide the Spaghetti Carbonara among individual plates or a serving dish.</li>
                    <li>Garnish with additional grated Pecorino Romano cheese and freshly ground black pepper, if desired.</li>
                    <li>Serve immediately and enjoy!</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>Note: It's important to serve Spaghetti Carbonara right away, as it's best when the sauce is creamy and freshly made. Also, this dish contains raw eggs, so it may not be suitable for individuals with health concerns related to consuming raw eggs. Pregnant women, young children, the elderly, and people with compromised immune systems should avoid raw or undercooked eggs.</p>
