        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup Greek yogurt (plain or vanilla-flavored)</li>
            <li>1 cup mixed fresh berries (such as strawberries, blueberries, raspberries, and blackberries)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup granola (homemade or store-bought)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons honey or maple syrup (optional, for added sweetness)</li>
            <li>Fresh mint leaves for garnish (optional)</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash and prepare the berries: Rinse the fresh berries under cold water and gently pat them dry with a paper towel. If using strawberries, hull and slice them into bite-sized pieces.</li>
            <li>Sweeten the Greek yogurt (optional): If you prefer your yogurt to be a bit sweeter, you can stir in 1-2 tablespoons of honey or maple syrup into the Greek yogurt. Adjust the sweetness according to your taste.</li>
            <li>Layer the parfait: Take a clear glass or a parfait glass, and start layering the ingredients. Begin with a spoonful of Greek yogurt at the bottom of the glass.</li>
            <li>Add a layer of berries: Top the yogurt with a handful of mixed fresh berries, creating an even layer over the yogurt.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle granola: Sprinkle a layer of granola over the berries. You can use your favorite granola mix or a store-bought option with nuts and dried fruits for added texture and flavor.</li>
            <li>Repeat the layers: Continue layering the ingredients in the same order - Greek yogurt, fresh berries, and granola - until you reach the top of the glass.</li>
            <li>Garnish (optional): For an extra touch of freshness and aesthetics, you can garnish the top with a few fresh berries and a couple of mint leaves.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy: Your Greek Yogurt Parfait with Fresh Berries and Granola is ready to be served! You can either enjoy it immediately or refrigerate it for a few hours to allow the flavors to meld together. When ready to eat, grab a spoon and dig into the delicious layers of yogurt, berries, and crunchy granola.</li>

        <p>This Greek Yogurt Parfait is not only visually appealing but also a great way to get a dose of probiotics from the yogurt, vitamins and antioxidants from the fresh berries, and fiber and nutrients from the granola. Enjoy this wholesome and tasty treat at any time of the day!</p>
