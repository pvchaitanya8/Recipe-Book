        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>9 lasagna noodles (preferably no-boil)</li>
            <li>2 cups fresh spinach, chopped</li>
            <li>2 cups mushrooms, sliced</li>
            <li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 can (28 oz) crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 can (14 oz) diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional, for a spicy kick)</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 cups vegan ricotta cheese (store-bought or homemade)</li>
            <li>1 cup vegan mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
            <li>Fresh basil leaves for garnish (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to the temperature specified on the lasagna noodle package.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet or frying pan, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and sauté until translucent.</li>
            <li>Add the minced garlic and sauté for another minute until fragrant.</li>
            <li>Toss in the sliced mushrooms and cook until they release their moisture and start to brown.</li>
            <li>Pour in the crushed tomatoes and diced tomatoes (with their juices) into the pan. Stir in the tomato paste, dried oregano, dried basil, red pepper flakes (if using), salt, and pepper. Simmer the sauce for about 15 minutes on low heat, allowing it to thicken and the flavors to meld. Adjust seasonings to taste.</li>
            <li>While the sauce is simmering, prepare the vegan ricotta cheese. If you're using store-bought vegan ricotta, you can skip this step. If making it from scratch, blend together tofu, lemon juice, nutritional yeast, garlic powder, salt, and pepper until smooth and creamy.</li>
            <li>Pre-cook the lasagna noodles according to the package instructions if using regular lasagna noodles. However, if you are using no-boil lasagna noodles, they can go into the lasagna as is.</li>
            <li>In a 9x13 inch baking dish, spread a thin layer of the tomato sauce at the bottom to prevent the noodles from sticking.</li>
            <li>Place three lasagna noodles on top of the sauce, slightly overlapping. Spread a layer of the vegan ricotta cheese over the noodles, followed by a layer of chopped spinach.</li>
            <li>Add a layer of the mushroom and tomato sauce mixture over the spinach.</li>
            <li>Repeat the layers: noodles, ricotta cheese, spinach, and sauce, until you've used up all the ingredients. The final layer should be the tomato sauce.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the shredded vegan mozzarella cheese over the top.</li>
            <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes, or until the lasagna is heated through and the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
            <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 5-10 minutes or until the cheese on top is slightly browned.</li>
            <li>Once done, remove the lasagna from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.</li>
            <li>Optionally, garnish the lasagna with fresh basil leaves before serving.</li>
        </ol>
