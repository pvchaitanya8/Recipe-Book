        <p>A delicious and healthy alternative to traditional pasta dishes. Here's a step-by-step preparation method to make this refreshing meal:</p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 medium zucchinis</li>
            <li>2 ripe avocados</li>
            <li>1 cup fresh basil leaves</li>
            <li>1/4 cup pine nuts or walnuts (toasted)</li>
            <li>2-3 garlic cloves</li>
            <li>1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese (optional, for a non-vegan version)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>1/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Cherry tomatoes (optional, for garnish)</li>
            <li>Fresh basil leaves (optional, for garnish)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Prepare the zucchini noodles:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wash the zucchinis thoroughly and trim off both ends.</li>
                    <li>Using a spiralizer or julienne peeler, create long, thin noodles from the zucchinis. If you don't have a spiralizer, you can also use a vegetable peeler to make wide, flat "fettuccine-style" zucchini noodles.</li>
                    <li>Place the zucchini noodles in a colander, sprinkle some salt over them, and let them sit for about 15 minutes. This helps draw out excess moisture. After 15 minutes, gently pat them dry with paper towels.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Prepare the avocado pesto sauce:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cut the avocados in half, remove the pit, and scoop the flesh into a food processor or blender.</li>
                    <li>Add the fresh basil leaves, toasted pine nuts (or walnuts), garlic cloves, lemon juice, and grated Parmesan cheese (if using) to the food processor.</li>
                    <li>Season with salt and pepper according to your taste.</li>
                    <li>Blend the ingredients until you achieve a smooth and creamy consistency. While the food processor is running, drizzle in the olive oil gradually until everything is well combined.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Assemble the dish:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the prepared zucchini noodles with the avocado pesto sauce. Toss gently until the noodles are evenly coated with the sauce.</li>
                    <li>If the sauce is too thick, you can add a splash of water to reach your desired consistency.</li>
                    <li>Taste and adjust the seasoning if needed with more salt, pepper, or lemon juice.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Garnish and serve:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Divide the zucchini noodles into individual serving plates or bowls.</li>
                    <li>If desired, garnish with halved cherry tomatoes and some fresh basil leaves for extra color and flavor.</li>
                    <li>Serve immediately and enjoy your zucchini noodles with avocado pesto sauce while it's fresh and vibrant.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>This dish is best served right after preparation to enjoy the vibrant colors and textures. It's a great option for a light lunch or dinner, and you can even add grilled chicken, shrimp, or tofu for added protein. Enjoy!</p>
