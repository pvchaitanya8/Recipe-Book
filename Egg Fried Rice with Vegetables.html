        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups cooked rice (preferably cooled or day-old rice)</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>1 cup mixed vegetables (carrots, peas, corn, bell peppers, etc.), chopped</li>
            <li>1 small onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2-3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon oyster sauce (optional)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Green onions, sliced (for garnish)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the rice: If you don't have day-old rice, cook the rice according to package instructions and spread it out on a large tray or plate to cool. It's important to use cooled rice to prevent the fried rice from becoming mushy.</li>
            <li>Beat the eggs: In a small bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Heat the wok or large skillet: Place a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Add one tablespoon of vegetable oil and swirl it around to coat the bottom and sides of the pan.</li>
            <li>Cook the eggs: Pour the beaten eggs into the hot wok. Allow them to cook undisturbed for a few seconds until they begin to set at the bottom. Then gently scramble the eggs with a spatula until they are just cooked but still slightly soft. Transfer the cooked eggs to a plate and set aside.</li>
            <li>Cook the vegetables: In the same wok, add the remaining tablespoon of vegetable oil. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, and saut√© for about 1-2 minutes until they become fragrant and slightly softened. Add the mixed vegetables and continue to stir-fry for another 2-3 minutes until they are tender-crisp.</li>
            <li>Add the rice: Add the cooked rice to the wok with the vegetables. Use a spatula to break up any clumps and mix the rice evenly with the vegetables.</li>
            <li>Season the fried rice: Drizzle soy sauce and oyster sauce (if using) over the rice. Mix well, ensuring that the sauce is evenly distributed throughout the rice and vegetables. Taste the rice and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper as needed.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs and sesame oil: Return the cooked eggs to the wok and mix them into the fried rice. Drizzle sesame oil over the rice and give it a final stir.</li>
            <li>Garnish and serve: Transfer the egg fried rice with vegetables to serving plates. Garnish with sliced green onions for a pop of color and added freshness.</li>
        </ol>
