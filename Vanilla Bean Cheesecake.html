        <ul>

            <ul>
                <li>1 3/4 cups graham cracker crumbs</li>
                <li>1/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
            </ul>
            <li>For the cheesecake filling:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>24 ounces (680g) cream cheese, softened</li>
                <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
                <li>3 large eggs</li>
                <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
                <li>1 vanilla bean (or 2 teaspoons vanilla extract)</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
            </ul>
            <li>For the vanilla bean topping:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
                <li>1/4 cup powdered sugar</li>
                <li>1 vanilla bean (or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract)</li>
            </ul>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 325°F (163°C). Grease a 9-inch springform pan with butter or non-stick cooking spray and set it aside.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, mix together the graham cracker crumbs, 1/4 cup granulated sugar, and melted butter until the crumbs are evenly coated. Press the mixture firmly into the bottom of the prepared springform pan to create the crust. You can use the back of a spoon or a flat-bottomed glass to help with this. Make sure the crust is even and compact.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese and 1 cup granulated sugar together until smooth and creamy. If using a stand mixer, use the paddle attachment on medium speed. You can also use a handheld electric mixer for this step.</li>
            <li>Cut the vanilla bean lengthwise and scrape out the seeds using a knife or the back of a spoon. Add the vanilla bean seeds (or vanilla extract if using) to the cream cheese mixture and mix well.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs, one at a time, to the cream cheese mixture, mixing well after each addition. Be sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl to ensure even mixing.</li>
            <li>Stir in the sour cream and flour until the batter is smooth and well combined.</li>
            <li>Pour the cheesecake filling over the prepared crust in the springform pan. Smooth out the top with a spatula to make it even.</li>
            <li>Place the springform pan on a baking sheet (in case of any leaks) and bake the cheesecake in the preheated oven for about 1 hour or until the edges are set but the center is slightly jiggly.</li>
            <li>Turn off the oven and crack the oven door slightly. Let the cheesecake cool in the oven for about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Remove the cheesecake from the oven and let it cool completely at room temperature before refrigerating it for at least 4 hours or preferably overnight.</li>
            <li>For the vanilla bean topping, in a chilled mixing bowl, whip the heavy cream, powdered sugar, and vanilla bean seeds (or vanilla extract) until stiff peaks form.</li>
            <li>Once the cheesecake is thoroughly chilled, remove it from the springform pan and transfer it to a serving plate. Spread the vanilla bean topping over the cheesecake, and if you like, you can garnish it with some additional vanilla bean seeds or a dusting of cocoa powder.</li>
            <li>Slice and serve your delicious Vanilla Bean Cheesecake, and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Remember to store any leftovers in the refrigerator for up to 4-5 days. Happy baking!</p>
