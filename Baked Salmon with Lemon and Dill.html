        <p>A delicious and healthy dish that is easy to prepare.</p>
        <p>Here's a step-by-step preparation method for this flavorful recipe:</p>

        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 salmon fillets (6-8 ounces each), skin-on or skinless</li>
            <li>2 lemons</li>
            <li>Fresh dill sprigs (about 1/4 cup), chopped</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). This temperature works well for baking salmon without overcooking it.</li>
            <li>Prepare the marinade: In a small bowl, combine the olive oil, minced garlic, juice of one lemon, half of the chopped dill, salt, and pepper. Mix well until all the ingredients are incorporated.</li>
            <li>Marinate the salmon: Place the salmon fillets in a shallow dish or a resealable plastic bag. Pour the marinade over the salmon, ensuring all pieces are well coated. For optimal flavor, you can let the salmon marinate in the refrigerator for at least 20-30 minutes, but if you're short on time, you can skip marinating and proceed directly to the next step.</li>
            <li>Prepare a baking dish: Line a baking sheet or dish with parchment paper or lightly grease it to prevent the salmon from sticking.</li>
            <li>Arrange the salmon: Place the marinated salmon fillets on the baking sheet, leaving some space between each piece.</li>
            <li>Add lemon slices: Slice the remaining lemon into thin rounds and place them on top of each salmon fillet. These lemon slices will add extra citrusy flavor during baking.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with dill: Sprinkle the remaining chopped dill over the salmon and lemon slices. Dill complements the salmon beautifully and adds a fresh herbal note to the dish.</li>
            <li>Bake the salmon: Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake the salmon for about 15-20 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fillets. Salmon is cooked when it easily flakes with a fork, but take care not to overcook it to keep it moist and tender.</li>
            <li>Serve and enjoy: Once the salmon is done baking, remove it from the oven. You can serve it directly on the baking sheet or transfer it to a serving platter. Garnish with extra dill if desired, and serve with your favorite side dishes like steamed vegetables, rice, or a fresh green salad.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Now you have a mouthwatering Baked Salmon with Lemon and Dill ready to delight your taste buds. Enjoy your flavorful and healthy meal!</p>
