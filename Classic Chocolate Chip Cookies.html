        <p>Classic chocolate chip cookies are a beloved treat loved by many. Here's a preparation method for making these delicious cookies:</p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
            <li>Optional: 1 cup chopped nuts (walnuts or pecans)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven: Preheat your oven to 375째F (190째C). Prepare baking sheets by lining them with parchment paper or silicone baking mats to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li>Cream the butter and sugars: In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. You can use a hand mixer or stand mixer for this step.</li>
            <li>Add the vanilla and eggs: Beat in the vanilla extract. Then, add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition until fully incorporated.</li>
            <li>Combine dry ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
            <li>Mix wet and dry ingredients: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, mixing on low speed (or by hand) until just combined. Be careful not to overmix at this stage.</li>
            <li>Add chocolate chips and nuts: Stir in the chocolate chips until evenly distributed throughout the dough. If you're adding nuts, now's the time to fold them in as well.</li>
            <li>Chill the dough (optional): For best results, cover the dough and refrigerate it for at least 30 minutes, and up to 24 hours. Chilling the dough helps the cookies hold their shape and intensifies the flavor.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven: If you chilled the dough, let it sit at room temperature for a few minutes to soften slightly. Then, preheat the oven again to 375째F (190째C).</li>
            <li>Scoop the dough: Use a cookie scoop or spoon to portion the dough into rounded tablespoons or desired size and place them on the prepared baking sheets, leaving space between each cookie to allow for spreading.</li>
            <li>Bake the cookies: Bake the cookies in the preheated oven for about 9 to 12 minutes or until the edges are golden brown. The centers may look slightly undercooked, but they will firm up as the cookies cool. For chewier cookies, remove them from the oven when the edges are set but still slightly soft in the center.</li>
            <li>Cool and enjoy: Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to wire racks to cool completely. Enjoy these classic chocolate chip cookies with a glass of milk or your favorite beverage!</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong> You can customize these cookies by using different types of chocolate chips (milk, dark, or white) or adding other mix-ins like shredded coconut or dried fruit. Have fun experimenting with the recipe to suit your preferences!</p>
