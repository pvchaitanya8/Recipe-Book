        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup dried chickpeas (or 2 cans of cooked chickpeas)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>3 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1-inch piece of ginger, grated</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon curry powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (adjust to your spice preference)</li>
            <li>1 can (400 ml) coconut milk</li>
            <li>2 cups mixed vegetables (carrots, bell peppers, zucchini, etc.), chopped</li>
            <li>1 cup spinach or kale, chopped</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon tomato paste</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Fresh cilantro, chopped, for garnish</li>
            <li>Cooked rice or naan bread, for serving</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>If using dried chickpeas, rinse them thoroughly and soak them overnight in water. The next day, drain the soaking water and rinse the chickpeas again.</li>
            <li>If using canned chickpeas, drain and rinse them under cold water.</li>
            <li>In a large pot or deep pan, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and sauté until they become soft and translucent.</li>
            <li>Add the minced garlic and grated ginger to the pot. Sauté for another minute or until the aroma of garlic and ginger fills the air.</li>
            <li>Stir in the curry powder, ground cumin, ground coriander, turmeric, and cayenne pepper. Cook the spices with the onions, garlic, and ginger for about 1-2 minutes to release their flavors.</li>
            <li>Pour in the coconut milk, and stir well to combine it with the spices and vegetables.</li>
            <li>Add the chopped mixed vegetables and chickpeas to the pot. If using dried chickpeas, ensure they are well-drained. Stir everything together.</li>
            <li>Mix in the tomato paste, which will add richness and depth to the curry.</li>
            <li>Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer. Cover the pot with a lid and let it cook for about 15-20 minutes or until the vegetables are tender and the flavors have melded together.</li>
            <li>As the curry simmers, check the seasoning and add salt and pepper to taste. Adjust the cayenne pepper if you want a spicier curry.</li>
            <li>Stir in the chopped spinach or kale during the last few minutes of cooking. They will wilt and add extra nutrients to the dish.</li>
            <li>Once the vegetables are cooked to your desired tenderness, and the curry has thickened to a creamy consistency, turn off the heat.</li>
            <li>Serve the Chickpea and Vegetable Coconut Curry over cooked rice or with some warm naan bread. Garnish with fresh chopped cilantro for a burst of freshness.</li>
        </ol>
