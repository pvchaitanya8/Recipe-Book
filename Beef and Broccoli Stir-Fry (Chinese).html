        <p>A classic Chinese dish that is both delicious and easy to prepare. Here's a step-by-step guide to preparing this flavorful meal:</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb (450g) beef sirloin or flank steak, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 cups broccoli florets</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1-inch piece of fresh ginger, minced</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons oyster sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon hoisin sauce</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cornstarch</li>
            <li>1/2 cup beef broth or water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil (peanut oil or sesame oil work well)</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Cooked white rice for serving</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the beef: Start by thinly slicing the beef across the grain. This helps to keep the meat tender when cooked. You can partially freeze the beef for about 20 minutes before slicing to make it easier.</li>
            <li>Marinate the beef: In a bowl, combine the soy sauce, minced garlic, minced ginger, and a pinch of pepper. Add the sliced beef to the bowl and mix it thoroughly with the marinade. Allow it to marinate for at least 15-20 minutes to infuse the flavors.</li>
            <li>Prepare the sauce: In a separate bowl, mix together the oyster sauce, hoisin sauce, cornstarch, and beef broth (or water). Stir until the cornstarch is fully dissolved. This sauce will add a rich and savory taste to the stir-fry.</li>
            <li>Blanch the broccoli: Bring a pot of water to a boil and add a pinch of salt. Add the broccoli florets to the boiling water and blanch them for about 2 minutes until they turn bright green and slightly tender. Drain the broccoli and immediately plunge it into ice water to stop the cooking process. This helps the broccoli retain its vibrant color and crispness.</li>
            <li>Stir-fry the beef and broccoli: Heat a wok or a large skillet over high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil and swirl it around the pan to coat the surface. When the oil is hot, add the marinated beef, spreading it out in a single layer. Let it sear for about 1-2 minutes on each side until it's browned and slightly crispy. Remove the beef from the wok and set it aside.</li>
            <li>Stir-fry the broccoli: In the same wok, add another tablespoon of oil and heat it up. Add the blanched broccoli and stir-fry for about 1-2 minutes until it's heated through.</li>
            <li>Combine the beef and broccoli: Return the seared beef to the wok with the broccoli, giving it a quick toss to combine.</li>
            <li>Add the sauce: Give the sauce mixture a quick stir to ensure it's well-mixed, then pour it over the beef and broccoli in the wok. Continue to stir-fry for another minute or two until the sauce thickens and coats the beef and broccoli evenly.</li>
            <li>Season and serve: Taste the stir-fry and add salt and pepper if needed. The soy sauce already provides some saltiness, so adjust to your preference. Once the flavors are balanced, remove the wok from the heat.</li>
            <li>Serve: Plate the Beef and Broccoli Stir-Fry over cooked white rice, and you have a delicious and satisfying Chinese dish ready to enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Remember, stir-fries come together quickly, so it's essential to have all your ingredients prepped and ready before you start cooking. Enjoy your homemade Beef and Broccoli Stir-Fry!</p>
