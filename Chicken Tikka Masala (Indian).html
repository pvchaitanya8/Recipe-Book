        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Marinating the Chicken:
                <ul>
                    <li>In a bowl, combine the yogurt, lemon juice, ginger-garlic paste, ground cumin, ground coriander, ground turmeric, garam masala, cayenne pepper, black pepper, and salt.</li>
                    <li>Add the chicken pieces to the marinade, ensuring they are well-coated. Cover the bowl and let it marinate in the refrigerator for at least 1-2 hours, preferably overnight, to allow the flavors to develop.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Grilling or Broiling the Chicken:
                <ul>
                    <li>Preheat your grill or broiler. If using a grill, preheat it to medium-high heat. If broiling, set your oven to the "broil" setting.</li>
                    <li>Thread the marinated chicken pieces onto skewers. If using wooden skewers, make sure to soak them in water for 30 minutes before using to prevent burning.</li>
                    <li>Grill or broil the chicken skewers for about 10-15 minutes, turning occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through and has a slight char. Cooking times may vary, so keep an eye on them to avoid overcooking.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Preparing the Tikka Masala Sauce:
                <ul>
                    <li>In a large saucepan or skillet, heat the vegetable oil or ghee over medium heat.</li>
                    <li>Add the finely chopped onions and cook until they become soft and translucent.</li>
                    <li>Stir in the minced garlic and grated ginger, cooking for another minute until fragrant.</li>
                    <li>Add the tomato paste, ground cumin, ground coriander, garam masala, paprika, and cayenne pepper. Cook the spices with the onion mixture for a couple of minutes to release their flavors.</li>
                    <li>Pour in the crushed tomatoes and let the sauce simmer for about 10 minutes, allowing it to thicken and develop its flavors.</li>
                    <li>Stir in the heavy cream or coconut milk and continue to simmer for another 5 minutes. Add sugar if desired, and season with salt according to taste.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Combining the Chicken and Sauce:
                <ul>
                    <li>Once the chicken is done grilling or broiling, remove the pieces from the skewers and add them to the Tikka Masala sauce.</li>
                    <li>Let the chicken simmer in the sauce for a few minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Serving:
                <ul>
                    <li>Garnish the Chicken Tikka Masala with chopped cilantro (coriander leaves).</li>
                    <li>Serve the dish hot, accompanied by steamed basmati rice or Indian bread like naan or roti.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
