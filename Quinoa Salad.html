        <p>Quinoa salad is a nutritious and delicious dish that can be enjoyed as a light meal or a side dish. Here's a simple and versatile preparation method for making a refreshing Quinoa Salad:</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup quinoa</li>
            <li>2 cups water or vegetable broth</li>
            <li>1 cucumber, diced</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper, diced</li>
            <li>1 yellow bell pepper, diced</li>
            <li>1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved</li>
            <li>1/4 cup red onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped</li>
            <li>1/4 cup fresh mint, chopped</li>
            <li>1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese (optional, for added creaminess and flavor)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup toasted pine nuts or slivered almonds (optional, for extra crunch)</li>
            <li>Juice of 1 lemon</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Rinse the quinoa thoroughly: Place the quinoa in a fine-mesh strainer and rinse it under cold water for a minute or two. This helps remove any bitterness from the quinoa's outer coating.</li>
            <li>Cook the quinoa: In a medium-sized saucepan, combine the rinsed quinoa and water (or vegetable broth) and bring it to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover the saucepan with a lid, and let the quinoa simmer for about 15 minutes or until all the water is absorbed and the quinoa becomes tender. Once done, fluff the quinoa with a fork and let it cool to room temperature.</li>
            <li>Prepare the vegetables: While the quinoa is cooling, wash and chop the cucumber, red bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, cherry tomatoes, red onion, parsley, and mint. You can adjust the quantities and use any other vegetables you prefer.</li>
            <li>Mix the dressing: In a small bowl, whisk together the lemon juice, extra-virgin olive oil, salt, and pepper to make the dressing.</li>
            <li>Combine the ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, add the cooked and cooled quinoa, diced vegetables, chopped herbs, and feta cheese (if using). Pour the dressing over the mixture and toss everything together until the ingredients are well combined and coated with the dressing.</li>
            <li>Add crunch (optional): If you like some crunch in your salad, toss in the toasted pine nuts or slivered almonds.</li>
            <li>Adjust seasoning: Taste the quinoa salad and adjust the seasoning as per your preference. You can add more lemon juice, salt, or pepper if needed.</li>
            <li>Chill and serve: Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or transfer the salad to an airtight container and refrigerate it for at least 30 minutes before serving. Chilling the salad allows the flavors to meld together and enhances the taste. Serve it chilled and enjoy your delicious and healthy Quinoa Salad!</li>
        </ol>

        <p>This salad is versatile, and you can modify it according to your taste. Feel free to add other ingredients like avocado, olives, chickpeas, or roasted vegetables to customize the salad further.</p>
