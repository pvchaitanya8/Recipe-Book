        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <h3>For the Filling:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>6 cups of peeled and sliced apples (such as Granny Smith, Honeycrisp, or a mix)</li>
            <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the Crumble Topping:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup old-fashioned rolled oats</li>
            <li>1/2 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup cold unsalted butter, cut into small cubes</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat the oven: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease a 9x13-inch baking dish with butter or non-stick cooking spray.
            </li>
            <li>
                Prepare the apple filling: In a large bowl, combine the sliced apples, granulated sugar, lemon juice, ground cinnamon, ground nutmeg, and all-purpose flour. Mix well until all the apples are coated evenly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer the apple filling: Spread the coated apple slices evenly in the greased baking dish, making sure to distribute them in a single layer.
            </li>
            <li>
                Prepare the crumble topping: In another bowl, combine the rolled oats, all-purpose flour, brown sugar, ground cinnamon, and salt. Mix well. Then, add the cold cubed butter to the mixture.
            </li>
            <li>
                Crumble the topping: Using your fingers or a pastry cutter, work the cold butter into the dry mixture until it resembles coarse crumbs and the butter is well incorporated. This will create the crumbly texture for the topping.
            </li>
            <li>
                Top the apples: Evenly distribute the crumble topping over the apple filling in the baking dish.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake the crisp: Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for about 40-45 minutes or until the topping turns golden brown, and the apple filling is bubbly and tender.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cool and serve: Once the Apple Cinnamon Crisp is done baking, remove it from the oven and let it cool slightly before serving. You can enjoy it warm as is or with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream for added indulgence.
            </li>
            <li>
                Store leftovers: If you have any leftovers, you can store them in an airtight container in the refrigerator for a few days. Reheat in the oven before serving to regain the crisp texture.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Enjoy your delicious Apple Cinnamon Crisp! It's a perfect dessert for any time of the year, but it's especially comforting during the fall season.
