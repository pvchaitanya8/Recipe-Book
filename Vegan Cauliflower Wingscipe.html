        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 medium cauliflower head, cut into florets</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour (or gluten-free flour for a gluten-free version)</li>
            <li>1 cup unsweetened almond milk (or any non-dairy milk)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons of water (flax egg substitute)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>For the sauce:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup hot sauce (such as Frank's RedHot or any other vegan brand)</li>
            <li>1/4 cup melted vegan butter or olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon maple syrup or agave nectar (adjust to taste)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>For the coating (choose one option):</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup breadcrumbs (use gluten-free breadcrumbs for a gluten-free version)</li>
            <li>OR 1 cup panko breadcrumbs (use gluten-free panko for a gluten-free version)</li>
            <li>OR 1 cup almond flour for a grain-free option</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Optional garnish:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Fresh chopped parsley or cilantro</li>
            <li>Vegan ranch dressing or vegan blue cheese dressing for dipping</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven: Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or lightly grease it to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li>Prepare the flax egg: In a small bowl, mix the ground flaxseed with water and let it sit for about 5 minutes until it thickens and resembles the texture of an egg.</li>
            <li>Prepare the batter: In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, almond milk, prepared flax egg, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, salt, and black pepper until you get a smooth batter.</li>
            <li>Coat the cauliflower: Dip each cauliflower floret into the batter, making sure to coat it evenly. Allow any excess batter to drip off before proceeding to the next step.</li>
            <li>Choose the coating: Roll each cauliflower-coated floret in your chosen coating (breadcrumbs, panko, or almond flour), pressing gently to ensure the coating adheres well. Place the coated cauliflower wings onto the prepared baking sheet in a single layer.</li>
            <li>Bake the cauliflower wings: Bake the cauliflower in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes or until they are crispy and golden brown, flipping them halfway through to ensure even cooking.</li>
            <li>Prepare the sauce: While the cauliflower wings are baking, in a separate bowl, mix the hot sauce, melted vegan butter or olive oil, and maple syrup or agave nectar to make the spicy glaze.</li>
            <li>Toss the wings in the sauce: Once the cauliflower wings are done baking, transfer them to a large mixing bowl and pour the sauce over them. Toss the wings gently until they are evenly coated with the spicy glaze.</li>
            <li>Serve: Garnish the vegan cauliflower wings with chopped parsley or cilantro if desired. Serve them hot with vegan ranch dressing or vegan blue cheese dressing on the side for dipping.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Enjoy your delicious and cruelty-free Vegan Cauliflower Wings as a tasty appetizer or party snack!</p>
