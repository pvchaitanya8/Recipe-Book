        <h2>Lentil Soup Recipe</h2>
        <p>This lentil soup is a hearty and flavorful meal that is perfect for a cold winter day. It is made with simple ingredients that you probably already have on hand, and it is easy to make.</p>
        <p>Here is the recipe:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ingredients:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>2 carrots, chopped</li>
            <li>2 celery stalks, chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>2 cups dried lentils, rinsed and picked over</li>
            <li>6 cups vegetable broth</li>
            <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, undrained</li>
            <li>Chopped fresh parsley, for garnish (optional)</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Instructions:</li>
          <ol>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion, carrots, and celery and cook until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic, thyme, cumin, coriander, salt, and pepper and cook for 1 minute more.</li>
            <li>Stir in the lentils, broth, and tomatoes. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 30-40 minutes, or until the lentils are tender.</li>
            <li>Puree half of the soup in a blender until smooth. Stir the pureed soup back into the pot and heat through.</li>
            <li>Serve hot, garnished with parsley if desired.</li>
          </ol>
          <li>Tips:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>You can use any type of lentils you like in this soup. Green lentils will cook faster than brown lentils, so keep that in mind when you're timing the cooking.</li>
            <li>If you don't have vegetable broth, you can use chicken broth or water. Just be sure to adjust the seasonings accordingly.</li>
            <li>This soup is a great way to use up leftover vegetables. If you have any carrots, celery, or onions that are starting to get soft, chop them up and add them to the soup.</li>
            <li>For a thicker soup, you can mash some of the lentils with a fork before stirring them back into the pot.</li>
            <li>Serve this soup with crusty bread or crackers for a complete meal.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
