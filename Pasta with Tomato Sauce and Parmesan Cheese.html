        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
          <li>1/2 onion, chopped</li>
          <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
          <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
          <li>1/2 teaspoon dried basil</li>
          <li>1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes (optional)</li>
          <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
          <li>1 pound pasta, cooked al dente</li>
          <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
          <li>Fresh basil, for garnish (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for 1 minute more.</li>
          <li>Stir in the crushed tomatoes, oregano, basil, red pepper flakes (if using), salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook for 20-30 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened.</li>
          <li>While the sauce is cooking, cook the pasta according to the package directions. Drain the pasta and add it to the sauce. Stir to combine.</li>
          <li>Serve immediately, topped with Parmesan cheese and fresh basil (if using).</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Tips:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>For a richer flavor, add 1/4 cup of heavy cream to the sauce after it has thickened.</li>
          <li>If you don't have dried oregano or basil, you can use 1 tablespoon of each, fresh.</li>
          <li>To make the sauce ahead of time, simply cook it until it has thickened, then let it cool completely. Store the sauce in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. When you're ready to serve, reheat the sauce over medium heat until warmed through.</li>
          <li>Enjoy!</li>
