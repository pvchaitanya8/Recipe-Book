        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Tart Crust:</strong>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>In a food processor, combine the flour, powdered sugar, and salt. Pulse a few times to mix.</li>
                    <li>Add the chilled butter cubes to the processor and pulse until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.</li>
                    <li>Add the egg yolk and 1 tablespoon of ice-cold water. Pulse again until the dough comes together. If needed, add another tablespoon of water slowly until the dough forms a ball.</li>
                    <li>Remove the dough from the food processor, flatten it into a disk, wrap it in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a tart pan with a removable bottom.</strong></li>

            <li><strong>Roll out the chilled tart dough on a floured surface until it's about 1/8 inch thick and larger than the size of your tart pan.</strong></li>

            <li><strong>Gently lift the rolled dough and place it into the tart pan. Press the dough into the pan and up the sides, trimming any excess from the edges.</strong></li>

            <li><strong>Prick the bottom of the tart crust with a fork to prevent it from puffing up during baking.</strong></li>

            <li><strong>Line the crust with parchment paper or aluminum foil and fill it with pie weights or dried beans to keep the crust flat during baking.</strong></li>

            <li><strong>Bake the tart crust in the preheated oven for about 15 minutes. Then, remove the parchment paper and weights and bake for an additional 5-8 minutes or until the crust turns golden brown. Allow it to cool completely.</strong></li>

            <li><strong>Pastry Cream:</strong>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>In a saucepan, heat the milk over medium heat until it starts to simmer. Remove it from the heat.</li>
                    <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, sugar, and cornstarch until smooth and pale.</li>
                    <li>Slowly pour the hot milk into the egg mixture, whisking continuously.</li>
                    <li>Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly until it thickens and comes to a boil.</li>
                    <li>Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla extract. Transfer the pastry cream to a bowl, cover the surface with plastic wrap to prevent a skin from forming, and let it cool to room temperature.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Assembling the Fresh Fruit Tart:</strong>
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>Once the tart crust and pastry cream have cooled, spread the pastry cream evenly inside the tart crust.</li>
                    <li>Wash and dry the fresh fruits. Slice larger fruits like strawberries and kiwi, if desired.</li>
                    <li>Arrange the fresh fruits on top of the pastry cream in a decorative pattern.</li>
                    <li>If desired, warm some apricot or peach jam and brush it lightly over the fruits to give them a shiny glaze.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>

            <li><strong>Chill the Fresh Fruit Tart in the refrigerator for at least an hour before serving. This will help set the pastry cream and enhance the flavors.</strong></li>

            <li><strong>Slice and serve the Fresh Fruit Tart, and enjoy!</strong></li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>Note:</strong> You can get creative with the fruit combinations, using seasonal fruits to make the tart even more delightful.</p>
