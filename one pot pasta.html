        <p>One-pot pasta is a quick and easy dish that requires minimal preparation and cleanup. Here's a step-by-step guide to making a delicious one-pot pasta:</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>12 ounces (340g) of dried pasta (spaghetti, penne, or any other variety)</li>
            <li>4 cups (1 liter) of vegetable or chicken broth (low sodium, if possible)</li>
            <li>1 can (14 ounces/400g) of diced tomatoes (or use fresh diced tomatoes)</li>
            <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>3-4 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1-2 cups of vegetables of your choice (spinach, broccoli, bell peppers, etc.)</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon of olive oil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of dried basil</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon of red pepper flakes (optional, for some heat)</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>Grated Parmesan cheese (optional, for garnish)</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the ingredients: Finely chop the onion, mince the garlic, and dice the vegetables (if using any). Measure out the pasta, broth, canned tomatoes, and spices, so they're ready to go.</li>
            <li>Heat the pot: Choose a large, deep skillet or pot with a lid. Place it on the stove over medium heat and add the olive oil.</li>
            <li>Sauté the onions and garlic: Once the oil is hot, add the chopped onions and garlic to the pot. Sauté them for a few minutes until the onions become translucent and fragrant.</li>
            <li>Add tomatoes and vegetables: Pour in the canned diced tomatoes (with their juices) and the diced vegetables. Stir everything together and let it cook for a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the pasta and broth: Now, add the dry pasta to the pot, spreading it out evenly. Pour the broth over the pasta, making sure it's mostly submerged. You may need to adjust the amount of broth slightly depending on the size and shape of the pot.</li>
            <li>Season the dish: Sprinkle the dried oregano, dried basil, red pepper flakes (if using), salt, and pepper over the pasta and broth mixture. Give it a gentle stir to distribute the seasoning.</li>
            <li>Bring to a simmer: Increase the heat to medium-high and bring the mixture to a simmer. Once it starts simmering, reduce the heat to medium-low.</li>
            <li>Cook the pasta: Cover the pot with a lid and let the pasta cook for about 10-12 minutes, or until the pasta is tender. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li>Check the seasoning: Taste the pasta to check if it's cooked to your desired level of tenderness. Adjust the seasoning with more salt and pepper if needed.</li>
            <li>Serve: Once the pasta is cooked and the sauce has thickened, remove the pot from the heat. Serve the one-pot pasta in individual plates or bowls. Optionally, you can sprinkle some grated Parmesan cheese on top before serving.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Enjoy your easy and delicious one-pot pasta! It's a versatile dish that can be customized with different vegetables and spices according to your taste.</p>
