            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>For serving:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Small soft corn tortillas</li>
            <li>Sliced pineapple</li>
            <li>Chopped white onions</li>
            <li>Chopped fresh cilantro</li>
            <li>Lime wedges</li>
            <li>Salsa (such as salsa verde or salsa roja)</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h4>Prepare the marinade:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a bowl, place the dried guajillo and ancho chilies, and cover them with boiling water. Let them soak for about 15-20 minutes until they soften.</li>
                    <li>In a blender or food processor, combine the soaked chilies, garlic, pineapple juice, orange juice, white vinegar, achiote paste (if using), ground cumin, dried oregano, ground coriander, smoked paprika, ground cinnamon, ground cloves, salt, and pepper.</li>
                    <li>Blend until you get a smooth and well-combined marinade.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Marinate the pork:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Place the thinly sliced pork in a large mixing bowl or a resealable plastic bag.</li>
                    <li>Pour the marinade over the pork, making sure it's evenly coated.</li>
                    <li>Cover the bowl or seal the bag and refrigerate for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight. This allows the flavors to penetrate the meat and make it tender and flavorful.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Preparing the Tacos al Pastor:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Preheat your grill or broiler on high heat.</li>
                    <li>If you're using a spit for grilling, thread the marinated pork slices onto the skewer, making sure they are tightly packed together.</li>
                    <li>If you're using the broiler, spread the marinated pork in a single layer on a baking sheet.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Cooking the Tacos al Pastor:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>If using a grill with a spit, cook the pork on medium-high heat, rotating the skewer occasionally until the meat is cooked through and has a slightly charred and caramelized exterior. This should take about 10-15 minutes.</li>
                    <li>If using the broiler, cook the pork for about 8-10 minutes, flipping the slices halfway through to ensure even cooking and caramelization.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Assembling the Tacos:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Warm the soft corn tortillas on a hot skillet or over an open flame until they are pliable.</li>
                    <li>To each tortilla, add a few slices of the cooked pork.</li>
                    <li>Top with sliced pineapple, chopped onions, chopped cilantro, and a squeeze of lime juice.</li>
                    <li>Serve the Tacos al Pastor with your favorite salsa on the side.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
