        <p>A delicious and healthy meal. Here's a step-by-step preparation method to make this dish:</p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>1 cup brown rice</li>
            <li>2 cups broccoli florets</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
            <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Lemon wedges (for serving, optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Preparation:</h2>

        <h3>1. Marinate the Chicken:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine 1 tablespoon olive oil, minced garlic, paprika, dried thyme, salt, and black pepper.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken breasts to the bowl and coat them thoroughly with the marinade.</li>
            <li>Cover the bowl and let the chicken marinate in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. For best results, you can marinate it overnight.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Cook Brown Rice:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Rinse the brown rice in cold water until the water runs clear.</li>
            <li>In a medium-sized saucepan, bring 2 cups of water to a boil.</li>
            <li>Add the rinsed brown rice to the boiling water and stir.</li>
            <li>Reduce the heat to low, cover the saucepan with a lid, and let the rice simmer for about 40-45 minutes or until the rice is tender and the water is absorbed.</li>
            <li>Fluff the rice with a fork and keep it warm while you prepare the chicken and broccoli.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Grill the Chicken:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. You can also use a grill pan on the stovetop if you don't have an outdoor grill.</li>
            <li>Remove the marinated chicken breasts from the bowl and let any excess marinade drip off.</li>
            <li>Brush the grill grates with a little oil to prevent sticking.</li>
            <li>Place the chicken breasts on the grill and cook for about 5-6 minutes per side or until the chicken is cooked through and reaches an internal temperature of 165°F (74°C). The cooking time may vary depending on the thickness of the chicken breasts.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Steam the Broccoli:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>While the chicken is grilling, steam the broccoli.</li>
            <li>Fill a large pot with about an inch of water and bring it to a boil.</li>
            <li>Place a steamer basket in the pot and add the broccoli florets to the basket.</li>
            <li>Cover the pot with a lid and steam the broccoli for about 3-5 minutes, or until the broccoli is tender-crisp and bright green.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Serve:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Once the chicken is grilled to perfection, remove it from the grill and let it rest for a couple of minutes before slicing.</li>
            <li>Divide the cooked brown rice among serving plates and top with sliced grilled chicken and steamed broccoli.</li>
            <li>You can drizzle a little extra olive oil over the chicken and broccoli for added flavor.</li>
            <li>Serve the Grilled Chicken with Steamed Broccoli and Brown Rice with lemon wedges on the side for an extra burst of freshness (optional).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Enjoy your nutritious and delicious Grilled Chicken with Steamed Broccoli and Brown Rice!</p>
