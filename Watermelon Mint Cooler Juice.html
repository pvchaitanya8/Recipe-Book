        <h2>Watermelon Mint Juice Recipe</h2>
        <p>This refreshing and delicious juice is a great way to get a boost of hydration and nutrients on a hot summer day.</p>
        <p>Ingredients:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>1 pound watermelon, peeled, seeded, and cut into chunks</li>
          <li>1/2 cup fresh mint leaves, plus more for garnish</li>
          <li>1/4 cup lime juice</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon sugar (optional)</li>
          <li>Ice cubes, for serving</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Instructions:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>In a blender, combine the watermelon, mint leaves, lime juice, and sugar (if using). Blend until smooth.</li>
          <li>Strain the juice through a fine-mesh sieve into a pitcher.</li>
          <li>Serve over ice, garnished with mint leaves.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Tips:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>For a more intense mint flavor, add a few more mint leaves to the blender.</li>
          <li>If you don't have a blender, you can mash the watermelon and mint leaves together with a fork or potato masher. Then, strain the juice through a fine-mesh sieve.</li>
          <li>You can also add a splash of club soda or ginger ale to the juice for a bit of fizz.</li>
          <li>This juice is best served immediately, but it can also be stored in the refrigerator for up to 24 hours.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Health Benefits:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Watermelon and mint are both very healthy fruits. Watermelon is a good source of vitamins A and C, as well as lycopene, an antioxidant that has been linked to a reduced risk of cancer. Mint is a good source of vitamin C and menthol, which has a cooling effect on the body.</li>
          <li>This juice is a great way to get a boost of hydration and nutrients on a hot summer day. It's also a refreshing and delicious way to cool down.</li>
