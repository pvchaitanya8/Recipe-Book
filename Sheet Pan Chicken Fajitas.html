        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound (about 450g) boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs, sliced into thin strips</li>
            <li>3 bell peppers (red, green, and yellow), sliced into thin strips</li>
            <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons fajita seasoning mix (store-bought or homemade)</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>Flour tortillas, for serving</li>
            <li>Optional toppings: shredded cheese, sour cream, salsa, guacamole, chopped cilantro, lime wedges, etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven: Set the oven to 425°F (220°C) and place the oven rack in the middle position.</li>
            <li>Prepare the vegetables: Wash the bell peppers and remove the seeds and stems. Cut them into thin strips.
                Peel the onion and cut it into thin slices.</li>
            <li>Slice the chicken: Wash the chicken breasts or thighs and pat them dry with paper towels. Slice the
                chicken into thin strips.</li>
            <li>Season the chicken and vegetables: In a large bowl, combine the chicken strips, sliced bell peppers, and
                onion. Drizzle the olive oil over the mixture, then add the fajita seasoning, salt, and pepper. Toss
                everything together until the chicken and vegetables are evenly coated with the seasoning.</li>
            <li>Assemble on a sheet pan: Line a large sheet pan with parchment paper or aluminum foil for easy cleanup.
                Spread the seasoned chicken and vegetable mixture in a single layer on the sheet pan.</li>
            <li>Roast in the oven: Place the sheet pan in the preheated oven and roast for about 20-25 minutes or until
                the chicken is cooked through and the vegetables are tender and slightly charred around the edges. You
                can stir the mixture halfway through the cooking time to ensure even cooking.</li>
            <li>Warm the tortillas: While the chicken fajitas are roasting, wrap the tortillas in foil and warm them in
                the oven for the last 5 minutes of the cooking time.</li>
            <li>Serve: Remove the sheet pan from the oven and allow it to cool slightly. Serve the Sheet Pan Chicken
                Fajitas with the warm tortillas and your choice of optional toppings like shredded cheese, sour cream,
                salsa, guacamole, chopped cilantro, and lime wedges.</li>
            <li>Enjoy: Assemble your chicken fajitas by placing some of the roasted chicken and vegetables onto a warm
                tortilla, add your favorite toppings, fold it up, and enjoy your delicious homemade Sheet Pan Chicken
                Fajitas!</li>
        </ol>
